The idea is to implement an object detection system to identify hand, bin, trash.

We’re going to be bulding Trashify 🚮, an object detection model which incentivises people to pick up trash in their local area by detecting bin, trash, hand.

If all three items are detected, a person gets +1 point!

For example, say you were going for a walk around your neighbourhood and took a photo of yourself picking up a piece (with your hand or trash arm) of trash and putting it in the bin, you would get a point.

With this object detection model, you could deploy it to an application which would automatically detect the target classes and then save the result to an online leaderboard.

The incentive would be to score the most points, in turn, picking up the most piecces of trash, in a given area.
